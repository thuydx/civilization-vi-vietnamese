			<Text>In this scenario you must guide your Medieval civilization through the infamous Black Death, keeping its cultural and scientific efforts alive as the population suffers death and despair. To win, you must unlock either the final Technology (Invention) or the final Civic (The Middle Class), sowing the seed of the Enlightenment to come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]THE PLAGUE[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over 85 turns the Black Death will sweep across the continent in waves. It originates in port cities in every nation and spreads outward across the landscape. It can spread to any land tile except Mountains, and will spread more easily to cities, roads, Coasts that contain Harbor districts, and rural improvements. When the plague arrives in a tile it becomes [COLOR:Red]Plague-Stricken[ENDCOLOR] for a number of turns. When the turns are up the tile will recover, but while plague-stricken it suffers the following effects:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR:Red][ICON_BULLET]Plague-stricken tiles cannot be worked by citizens, cannot be improved or repaired, and cannot be used to construct districts or add buildings if a district already exists[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the tile is a city center, there is a high chance one population will die each turn the plague remains. This chance can be reduced by constructing certain buildings or using certain government policies[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Units that end their turn on a plague-stricken tiles suffer 20 damage[ENDCOLOR][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To combat the Black Death, look to preserve your cities' power to keep working through the calamity. Build essential districts while your citizens are able. Keep your [ICON_Gold] Gold and [ICON_Faith] Faith reserves high to purchase buildings and units when your cities are crippled. Establish centers of science and culture early and protect them as best you can. When Plague Doctors become available, use them to safeguard your most vulnerable areas or shore up the Loyalty of cities that are wavering.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Difficulty affects [ICON_GOLD] Gold and [ICON_FAITH] Faith.</Text>
