		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_DELICATE_ARCH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>A remarkable rock formation long ago caught the attention of people in the American southwest. The towering formation resembles the waist and legs of a bow legged person. Newspaper editors nicknamed it the “Gigantic Window,” “Chaps,” and “Schoolmarm’s Bloomers,” though Frank Beckwith’s “Delicate Arch” stuck in 1934.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_DELICATE_ARCH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The precarious sandstone arch is as tall as a six-story building, which unfortunately sealed its fate. Both gravity and Utah’s winds will eventually lead to the arch’s collapse. Nature alone hasn’t taken its toll—despite its name, some ill-advised attempts to climb the Delicate Arch have damaged the majestic structure.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_EYE_OF_THE_SAHARA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>A great blue eye gazes out from the sands deep within the Sahara Desert, and few alive have seen it for themselves. This unblinking Eye of the Sahara, formally known as the Richat Structure, is nearly twenty-five miles across. Its vibrant colors make an easily recognizable landmark for astronauts, some of the few who have seen it in its entirety.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_EYE_OF_THE_SAHARA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>While the origins of the Richat Structure remain widely debated, the initial speculation of a meteorite impact bore no fruit. The prevailing geological theory is that the Eye of the Sahara is an “eroded symmetrical uplift” (more plainly, a type of dome made from layered rocks).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_LAKE_RETBA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The “Pink Lake” gets its name from its intense, strawberry pink water. This color changes from pale pink to an alarming rusty red depending on the time of day, season, and composition of the lake. Algae living within the lake, not pollution, cause its shifting palette. For the Senegalese locals, the lake’s changing waters are simply part of everyday life. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_LAKE_RETBA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Retba’s color is not its only unusual quality. The lake’s hypersalinic water—similar to the Dead Sea—lets a swimmer float on the lake without effort. This means that diving into the lake is not recommended. (Nor is drinking the water.)</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_MATTERHORN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The jagged precipice of the Matterhorn stands alone amongst the Alps. Its giant spire reaches nearly 15,000 feet, dominating the landscape of valleys surrounding it. As with most tall mountains, people saw the Matterhorn and decided to climb it.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_MATTERHORN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Mountaineers long considered the Matterhorn a worthy opponent. One 19th Century mountaineer famously declared it unclimbable, but this claim was proven false when Edward Whymper and a party of ten other climbers began their ascent on July 14th, 1865. Though the Matterhorn claimed the lives of four companions, Whymper’s party was the first to conquer the mountain. (The mountaineer who declared it “unclimbable” was Whymper himself, who had tried and failed multiple times before.)</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_RORAIMA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Mount Roraima juts 9000 ft. above the rainforests of South America. This sandstone tabletop mountain—called “the mother of all waters” by locals—inspired the setting for a number of stories and myths. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World took inspiration from the landscape, as well as the account of Sir Everard im Thurn’s expedition. Thurn, an explorer and botanist, was the first to climb Roraima successfully.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_RORAIMA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The mountain hosts a substantial amount of unique flora and fauna. Unlike Doyle’s novel, the real Mount Roraima has no dinosaurs. (If it does, they haven’t made their presence known.)</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_UBSUNUR_HOLLOW_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The land of Ubsunur Hollow (or “Uvs Nuur Basin”) is a pocket in time. Few signs of human life mark this Eastern Siberian region, but for the barrows dug for the ancient dead, massive stones erected as ceremonial monuments, and the haunting sounds of Tuvan throat singing.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_UBSUNUR_HOLLOW_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The basin, just smaller than Puerto Rico, spans multiple biomes. All manner of unique species find a home in the Hollow’s deserts, marshes, tundra, and saltwater lakes. One such animal is the endangered snow leopard, once hunted to near-extinction. Now that the area is a protected reserve, the leopards can repopulate without fear of natural predators (beyond the occasional farmer concerned about their livestock).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_ZHANGYE_DANXIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The ragged sandstone mountains of Zhangye Danxia span over 120 square miles near the heart of modern China, in the foothills of the Qilian Mountains. Seemingly painted across its rugged landscape are bands of red, blue, green, and gold—a result of naturally occurring chemical reactions, erosion, and tectonic shifts between the Indian and Eurasian plates.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_FEATURES_PAGE_FEATURE_ZHANGYE_DANXIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The colors of the “Rainbow Mountains” are so vibrant that photographs of the region can appear digitally filtered. The available light can further alter the coloration, making Zhangye Danxia a true wonder to behold at any time of day.</Text>
		</Row>
		
		<!-- Districts -->
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_DISTRICTS_PAGE_DISTRICT_SEOWON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>An educational crisis in 16th Century Korea brought about the seowon, a private institution designed to fill the scholarly void. The heavy emphasis on Confucian teachings and rituals were often expressed in the modest appearance of its structures. The preponderance of aristocratic children attending made the seowon ideal for discussing politics. This blend of Neo-Confucianism and topical matters created an ideal setting to explore new ideas about Korea’s contemporary culture and government.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_DISTRICTS_PAGE_DISTRICT_IKANDA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The ikanda (also known as a “kraal” or “umuzi”) were self-sufficient, fortified Zulu homesteads. A double palisade protected its residents—the inner wall kept livestock in and the outer wall kept interlopers out. Ikanda were ideally placed uphill for reasons both practical and strategic: rainwater flowed downhill to clean the ikanda, while opponents were forced to attack an elevated position.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_DISTRICTS_PAGE_DISTRICT_IKANDA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Shaka’s revolutionary changes to the military capitalized on the traditional Zulu age-grade system. Young men of the same age lived, trained, and fought together in regiments, relying on the ikanda’s bounty to provide their food, arms, and armor.</Text>
		</Row>

		<!-- Units -->
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_SCOTTISH_HIGHLANDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>In the wake of Scotland’s 1719 Jacobite rising, the British Army  recruited loyal Scottish clans (the Campbells, Grants, Frasers, and Munros) to promote unity and keep the peace in the Scottish Highlands. The first of the Highland Regiments was known as the Black Watch thanks to their classic dark tartans—with prominent red waistcoats to show their loyalty to Great Britain.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_SCOTTISH_HIGHLANDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The British Army regulars carried a musket and bayonet into battle. The Highlanders took it a step further by charging into the fray with broadswords, an arguably uncommon weapon for the 18th Century. They first saw combat outside of their homeland at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745), where a French writer described them as “Highland furies” who fought with “more violence than ever did a sea driven by a tempest.” Highlanders continue to serve in modern times, though their broadswords are (presumably) ceremonial.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_KOREAN_HWACHA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The Korean hwacha (or “fire chariot”) launched the most terrifying fireworks display of the 15th Century. At first glance, this simple, two-wheeled wooden cart bears little more than a slotted horizontal board as its cargo. When fully loaded and fired, dozens of rocket-propelled projectiles would streak out from those slots, raining a steel-tipped volley upon distant enemy formations.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_KOREAN_HWACHA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>This efficient death machine came to prominence when it helped repel a late 16th Century Japanese invasion of Korea. The hwacha presence at the Battle of Haengju significantly aided the 3,400 Korean defenders against an invading samurai infantry nine times their size.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_ZULU_IMPI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The powerful warrior regiments of the Zulu were already a formidable force when the ambitious Shaka taught them new techniques: combining the iklwa (a short, stabbing spear with a broader blade than a throwing spear) and the ishlangu (a large, oval shield with cowhide layered on top). They trained to form shield walls, both to blunt projectiles and to hide their true numbers, and attack with a “buffalo horns” formation—greener troops would sweep out and around to pin the enemy’s flanks (the horns), while a more experienced center would slam into the pinned enemy (the rest of the buffalo).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_ZULU_IMPI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The impi training regimes under Shaka were nothing less than brutal, but harsh conditioning led to tightly bonded, well-disciplined soldiers able to carry out complex formations with ease. The impi became a highly mobile force, nigh-unstoppable against anything short of repeating rifles and high explosives.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_DE_ZEVEN_PROVINCIEN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>For a fledgling nation bordering a small patch of the North Sea, the Dutch fleet of the late 17th Century was rather exceptional. Its powerful ships of the line were nearly half the length of a football field (either variety), armed with a minimum of 80 guns spread across two gun decks.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_DE_ZEVEN_PROVINCIEN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>A typical Dutch ship of this class was the flagship De Zeven Provinciën (“The Seven Provinces”), the naval backbone of multiple battles in the Anglo-Dutch wars—battles nobody expected a mercantile nation to win. Nevertheless, these ships proved the Dutch could hold their own against other (presumably) mightier naval powers.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_MONGOLIAN_KESHIG_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The Mongolian keshig were the elite imperial guard of the Great Kahn. These mounted warriors, originally comprised of Genghis Khan’s most loyal fighters, grew to 10,000 strong among later khans. The keshig were well equipped, using their composite bows and mobility to harry opponents from a distance. As horse archers, they were second to none. Their peculiar rank as the Khan’s guard put them above even the commanding officers of an army—unsurprising, for they were predominantly composed of young warriors from prominent households.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_GEORGIAN_KHEVSURETI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The warriors from Georgia’s Khevsureti territory maintained their traditions for countless generations. (Until the early 20th Century, they continued to fight with weapons and armor more suited to medieval times.) These fierce Georgians dressed in chainmail and carried swords, axes, and small, black bucklers adorned with crosses for nighttime raids—due to the shield’s color, the warriors were practically invisible in the moonlight. Though tradition was their watchword, they did adapt with the times, incorporating firearms as their importance on the battlefield became unmistakable.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_MAPUCHE_MALON_RAIDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The 16th Century brought a Spanish invasion to what is now southern Chile. It also brought horses, which the Mapuche had never seen before encountering the conquistadors. Their presence on the battlefield forced the Mapuche to adjust their tactics. They quickly learned how to use horses, turning one of the greatest Spanish advantages against them. The mounted malón raiders—so named for their retributive attacks on invaders—would launch quick raids to harass an enemy, before leading a responding enemy into an ambush.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_CREE_OKIHTCITAW_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Roughly translating to “warrior,” the okihtcitaw had a much more important role within Cree society than merely serving as combatants. The sons of chiefs, they protected the tribe when it traveled and kept order when it settled. They also policed buffalo hunts to ensure that no one hunter began before any other. The Cree considered these seasoned warriors incredibly brave and skilled in combat, a step above their peers—often charismatic and clever, allowing them to serve as effective leaders in times of war and peace.</Text>
		</Row>

		<!-- Buildings -->
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_BUILDINGS_PAGE_BUILDING_ORDU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Simply translated, “ordu” means “palace tent.” However, an ordu was something much more than just a simple tent—it was the center of the tribe for the nomadic Mongolians.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_BUILDINGS_PAGE_BUILDING_ORDU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>An ordu served as the headquarters and main encampment for the Khan and his warriors. Though built for travel, it had style, from simple decorations to carefully sewn patterns. The ordu moved with the Khan and his warriors as they went on campaign, ensuring they always felt at home no matter where they traveled.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_BUILDINGS_PAGE_BUILDING_TSIKHE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>High over the landscape, situated in the hills and rocky cliffs, the Georgian fortresses guard the countryside. The tsikhe feature high curtain walls with either rounded or triangular merlons (the solid part of the “cut outs” on the wall). A tower stands at each intersection of joined wall.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_BUILDINGS_PAGE_BUILDING_TSIKHE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Georgian fortresses were particularly difficult to assault due to their position on the high ground. Although this type of fortress existed during the time of Alexander the Great, the Georgians used them effectively through the 17th Century.</Text>
		</Row>
		<!-- Improvements -->
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_CHEMAMULL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The Mapuche erected great wooden tombstones to remember their dead. These chemamull are carved from a single log and placed beside a person’s tomb. These “people of wood” stand as tall as a person, crafted as recognizably male or female figures with arms crossed over their bodies.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_CHEMAMULL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Mapuche built these wooden statues to protect the spirits of their loved ones. They believed each statue guarded its tomb and helped to reunite a spirit with its ancestors.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_GOLF_COURSE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>There is one singular, undeniable historical constant: people have always enjoyed hitting balls with sticks. Scotland’s turf happened to be a perfect place to hit balls with sticks across large stretches of land. Thus “golf,” which means, “hitting a ball with a stick across a large stretch of land.” Golf courses became the stretches of land in question, frustrating generations of golfers with sand traps, lakes, the rough, and drops from highlands.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_GOLF_COURSE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Golf (as played today) managed to survive and thrive despite various attempts at banning the sport, by people such as King James II (who the Scots rightly ignored) and even the Scottish Church, who did not want it played during holy days. The Church’s larger complaint was with golfers playing in churchyards, which were a very particular sort of hazard.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_MEKEWAP_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Made from birch bark, the mekewap was a long-term shelter for the Cree intended to lodge many people. The Cree carefully laid out the wood into a dome shape, then wrapped wooden strips around the shelter. They then wove the strips together for warmth, further securing it from the elements. This careful construction prevented rain from permeating the shelter.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_MEKEWAP_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_POLDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Most see the shoreline as an end. For the Dutch, the coastline was a challenge and an opportunity. The Netherlands spent 800 years reclaiming a country from the sea, using dikes, canals, levees, and pumps. Polders are the low-lying bits of land revealed when the water recedes.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_POLDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Dutch constantly maintained their polders to prevent the sea from reclaiming the land. Over the centuries, they mastered the art of keeping water out and reversing the effects of erosion. Today, more than a quarter of the Netherlands remains below sea level, leaving the country in a continuous game of tug-of-war with the North Sea.</Text>

			<Text>Scientists studying the South Pole brave its extreme conditions at the Amundsen-Scott Research Station. The station bears the names of Antarctic explorers Captain Robert Scott (the explorer who discovered the plateau where the South Pole is located) and Roald Amundsen (the first man to reach the South Pole—beating Scott’s expedition by 34 days). The original station, completed by the United States in 1957, became party to the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. All scientists working at the research station swore to freely explore and share scientific endeavors.</Text>

			<Text>Good intentions aside, the South Pole is no easy place to settle. The United States abandoned the station by 1975, whereupon it was buried under 30 feet of snow, excavated in 2010, and subsequently demolished with explosives. The new and improved Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (established in 1999) features an Atmospheric Research Observatory, a section for studying astrophysics, and most importantly, internet access.</Text>

			<Text>When Spain joined the late 15th Century’s exploration race, Queen Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragón realized they needed a firmer grasp on colonial trade and expansion. Through their Casa de Contratación, a “House of Trade” created to regulate trade and procurement, the Spanish crown controlled everything related to trade and sea travel down to the smallest details. Even their navigation and cartography school kept literal trade secrets in house.</Text>

			<Text>The East African city-state Kilwa Kisiwani was once a major destination for trade in the Indian Ocean. Ivory, gold, and perfumes flowed through its markets. At its height, Kilwa Kisiwani contained some of the finest architecture in East Africa: the Great Mosque (which remained the world’s largest mosque until the 16th Century) and Husuni Kubwa (a classy palace), both of which survived to the modern day.</Text>

Their traditional territory is primarily in the Subarctic and Plains regions of the modern provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, following along the Southwestern shore of Hudson Bay, and extending into portions of Quebec. Divided into regional and dialectal subgroups, and composed of dozens of individual bands and joined by a common Algonquian language, the Cree are closely related to a number of other First Nations, blending with those people and with outsiders over the course of their history through a policy of welcoming outsiders. </Text>

			<Text>Interconnected relationships between individuals and groups is a defining characteristic of Cree culture. This flexibility and welcoming of outsiders proved to be one of the Cree’s greatest strengths as a people. For most of their history, the Cree were organized into small, family-centered groups. Men were expected to hunt and defend the band, and women had the critical role of establishing the camp and its logistics. Members of the band could come and join and contribute, then leave and join another band if they wished. Outsiders could marry or be adopted into the group, cementing relationships between different Cree bands, bands of other indigenous people, or Metis and European individuals.</Text>

			<Text>Leadership of these groups hinged largely on the qualities of individuals, rather than strict heredity (a chief’s son, for example, was not guaranteed to assume leadership after his father). Chiefs were expected to demonstrate physical bravery, political savvy, wisdom, flexible thinking, and oratorical skills. Chiefs needed to demonstrate generosity both within and between groups, through gift-giving and mediation. They were expected to listen to counsel from all quarters in evaluating their decisions. Warrior and dancer societies provided opportunities for the next generation of prospective leaders to gain experience in war and politics to prove their worth.</Text>

In one, the ancestors of modern people were walking along in the clouds, and seeing the green and verdant world below, interlaced with creeks and rivers, and wished to live there. They ask a greater spirit to descend to this world below, and he fashions a giant bowl made from clouds, asks them to climb in, and lowers them to the world below.

The foundation of the Confederacy was trade with the European fur market. During this time, many Cree bands continued to move west out from the woodland and into the prairie, and their society underwent a rapid evolution from forest trappers and hunters to horse-mounted warriors and bison hunters. The Cree’s westward expansion brought them into conflict with other First Nations, and led to a series of intermittent conflicts between tribes such as the Blackfoot and the Snake.</Text>

When Pedro de Valdivia attempted to retake the settlement a short time later, his entire army was slaughtered, and he was unceremoniously captured and killed by the Mapuche under the leadership of his former slave.</Text>

Their family name has been associated with rulers of Caucasian Iberia since at least the 6th Century.
