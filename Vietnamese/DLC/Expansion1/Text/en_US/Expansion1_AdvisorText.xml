The same can happen to other civilizations, so keep an eye out for opportunities to destabilize others, and maybe even take a Free City into your own empire![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Loyalty is mainly affected by the number and nationality of citizens in and near the city. Having lots of your own population within 9 tiles will improve your Loyalty each turn. Populations belonging to other civilizations within 9 tiles will decrease it. The closer cities are together, the greater the effect is. Furthermore, the effect is greatly strengthened for civilizations in Golden Ages, and weakened by Dark Ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Assigning a Governor to a city, and ensuring it has enough Amenities, are other ways to ensure the Loyalty of your own cities.</Text>
