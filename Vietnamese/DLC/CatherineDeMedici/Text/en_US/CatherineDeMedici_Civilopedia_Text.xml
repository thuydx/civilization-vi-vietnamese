			<Text>Magnificence Catherine is the one leader who wants to amass a large collection of luxury resources of all types and quantities. Having a sumptuous collection of opulent goods makes her Court Festivals the cultural events where all leaders want to see and be seen. With enough such festivals and a large collection of Châteaux and mid-game wonders, France should be the leading candidate for a Culture Victory whenever this benevolent version of Catherine appears. She’s just dangerous enough at this game that you might have to fight a war against the French Garde Impériale to keep her from rolling to a quick victory.</Text>
