These city-states were governed and ruled by divinely-blessed rulers, and ranged from both small settlements to metropolises, such as the city-state known today as El Mirador. The city-states were never united politically in the same way as other Mesoamerican cultures, but they still shared a common language and culture.

			<Text>The Mayas chose a unique (and rather brave) place to settle. The Yucatán Peninsula wasn’t good for the kind of agriculture that most other civilizations practiced. Rather than settling around river valleys, the Maya built in tropical rainforests, with thin soil atop limestone foundations. A lack of a river meant that transportation was difficult, and finding drinking water problematic. But adversity can often lead to innovation. Where the water was too saline, the early Maya learned how to filter water through the limestone to make it drinkable, and where the jungle was too dense, they created raised earthen mounds on which to grow crops. One of the most important developments the Maya made was the creation of their written language, which consisted of glyphs.</Text>

In this era, there were over 40 Maya cities, with populations between 5,000 and 50,000 people. As these cities grew, the Maya thrived.

They then covered this with plaster, which was then painted. Any time they wanted to make improvements, they simply had to throw on some more limestone, cover it again, and paint it. There was no need for lengthy, complicated renovations, and they didn’t have to worry about structural issues. These pyramids were usually places of worship.

They were expected to lead battles and be good tacticians. The kings and societal elites who were defeated were captured and subsequently sacrificed.

Six years later, his mother passed away, leaving him in the care of his uncle. Bolívar’s uncle became the administrator of his inheritance and arranged for him to have several well-educated tutors. Many of these tutors would have a lasting impact on him and the philosophies he’d carry through his life.

			<Text>The Maya, who were both intensive agriculturalists as well as consummate mathematicians, took an intense interest in the movement of the heavens. At observatories in Mayan cities such as Palenque and Chichén Itzá, Mayan astronomers used an artificial horizon – a flat, circular platform of regular size – on which they marked carefully the points at which stars, planets, the moon and sun rose and fell each year. The Mayans used these observations to create detailed calendars. We are familiar with a solar one – our 365-day calendar is based upon the length of time that it takes for the sun to complete one cycle, but many cultures also use a lunar calendar (i.e. the length of time it takes for the moon to wax and wane 12 times). The Mayans added more and more cycles to this. For instance, the planet Venus takes 584 days to return to the same spot on the rim of one of the Mayan observatories’ artificial horizons. Noticing and recording this, the Maya also developed a Venusian calendar. Finally, to these astronomical observations, the Mayans added a 260-day calendar, one that lines up with the average time from human conception to birth.</Text>

Astronomy via the observatory was, for the Mayans, a way of tracking how the natural world, the supernatural world, and the political world were interlinked.

As a staple crop, maize allowed for the expansion and dominance of the great New World cities of the Maya and Aztec empires and remains important for Central American cuisine. Soon after European contact, maize spread to much of the Old World as well, as maize used different kinds of soil and topography from rice, wheat or barley. The grain was taken up enthusiastically in Africa, where maize was first introduced by the Portuguese, and where maize transformed agricultural practices and land use on that continent: maize cultivation, with its faster growing season and intensive processing work, opened new roles for women’s labor in many African societies, thus further altering social divisions in the societies in which it entered.</Text>

Before the colonial era, the region was home to a number of indigenous empires, namely Srivijaya, in Sumatra; Majapahit, on Java, and a network of Malay sultanates. When Europeans arrived, the Spanish and Portuguese sought (unsuccessfully) to convert the local population to Catholicism, and the English and Dutch looked to capitalize on the spice trade.

Singapore became important as the center for British colonial operations in the region: not only a trade hub, but a laboratory for new cash crops and an extension of the British presence in India eastward. The British brought a range of new migrants to the island: Hokkien, Cantonese, and Hakka migrants from southern China; Tamil workers from southern India, and new immigrants from elsewhere in Malaya.

While the Japanese eventually surrendered, the British failure to protect the island meant that the population of the Straits Settlements were reluctant to return to colonial rule – the era of European imperialism was over. Through mass demonstrations and agitation, they eventually won their independence, but the next question arose – what would the character of a post-British Malaya be? Majority-Muslim Malaya saw the Malays as the natural inheritors of the former colony, and the Chinese as interlopers. Bloody ethnic violence resulted, and ethnic Chinese fled in large numbers to majority-Chinese Singapore and Singapore’s leader, Lee Kuan Yew.

He led his horsemen into their camp at night, kicking up dust from the dry ground, then charging through it. Then, as the Spanish regrouped in a field of dry grass, Páez had the grass set on fire, again charging his men through the flames at the Spanish. </Text>

			<Text>Gran Colombia had conflicts across a wide region. At times, Bolívar undertook military campaigns directly to a conflicted area, as in the “Admirable Campaign” to liberate Venezuela. But at times, republican (anti-royal) armies seemed to be operating nearly independently. Such was the case with Santiago Mariño. Originally from the island of Margarita, in present-day Venezuela, Mariño attempted to single-handedly liberate the region from the Spanish. With Bolívar invading from the west, Mariño attacked Venezuela from the east. Each claimed to be fighting for the same cause, but with neither recognizing the other as dominant. A story goes that Mariño, dressed in his full military uniform, once boasted to his attache, “Antonio, I am young, rich, handsome, General in Chief at the age of 25!

After hearing of Latin America’s struggles against Spanish domination, MacGregor moved to Caracas seeking to get in on the action and declared his willingness to support the revolutionary cause. The local military, overlooking or ignoring MacGregor’s quirks, saw the benefit in having a veteran soldier in their employ, and set MacGregor to training troops.</Text>

This is certainly the case for Antonio Nariño, a wealthy merchant of Bogotá.  Nariño idolized French and American Revolutionary leaders (he hung a portrait of Benjamin Franklin above the mantle in his home). Nariño translated, printed and distributed the French Declaration of the Rights of Man to nascent revolutionaries in Latin America, something which got him in trouble with the Spanish authorities. The Declaration’s calls to free political association, national sovereignty, and the idea that social distinctions should exist only for the common good ran afoul of the Spanish claim to authority that rested on the idea of monarchy. But Nariño pressed things further, writing to the viceroy of the colony that “people are everywhere discontented” with Spanish rule. For this, Nariño was called the “Precursor” of the Revolution.

More than 50 ships and 20 planes allegedly have vanished within the triangle, never to be seen again. Although aliens are a popular theory for the mass disappearances of transportation and people, there are a few more mundane hypotheses to explain the triangle. Some scientists suggest that there are “air bombs” or microbursts that may have sunk the ships. Other scientists suggest giant “rogue waves” or magnetic shifts that lie about true north on compasses.
