			<Text>Rough Rider Teddy Roosevelt enjoys +5 [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength on his home continent and the ability to bring city-states under their sway through trade. He wants to expand rapidly across his continent while gaining the support of all nearby city-states. The Founding Fathers' civilization ability makes his choice of government important and can set him up for any victory type. His two post-Industrial unique units, including his favored Rough Riders, make him able to hit especially hard from the 20th Century onwards.</Text>

			<Text>Bull Moose Teddy favors the government choices of Classical Republic, Merchant Republic and then Democracy for they give him the Economic and Wildcard policy slots he needs as he heads toward a Culture Victory. With his Film Studio, National Park bonus, and the ability to earn [ICON_Science] Science and [ICON_Culture] Culture from Breathtaking tiles, Teddy is a cultural juggernaut, especially when possessing lands of great natural beauty.</Text>
