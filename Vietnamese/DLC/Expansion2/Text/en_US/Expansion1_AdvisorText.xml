			<Text>Settling a new city has expanded our civilization! With an empire larger than one city, it is important to keep an eye on the Loyalty of our citizens. If Loyalty decreases, the city is not as effective. If Loyalty drops to 0, the city will declare its independence and become a Free City. The same can happen to other civilizations, so keep an eye out for opportunities to destabilize others, and maybe even take a Free City into your own empire![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Loyalty is mainly affected by the number and nationality of citizens in and near the city. Having lots of your own population within 9 tiles will improve your Loyalty each turn. Populations belonging to other civilizations within 9 tiles will decrease it. The closer cities are together, the greater the effect is. Furthermore, the effect is greatly strengthened for civilizations in Golden Ages, and weakened by Dark Ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Assigning a Governor to a city, and ensuring it has enough Amenities, are other ways to ensure the Loyalty of your own cities.</Text>
