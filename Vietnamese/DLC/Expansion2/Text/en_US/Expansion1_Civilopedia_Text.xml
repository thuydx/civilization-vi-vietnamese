			<Text>A Defensive Pact is an agreement between two leaders to come to each other's aid when targeted by a Declaration of War.

For example, Gilgamesh and Cleopatra have a Defensive Pact, and Pedro and Peter have a Defensive Pact. Gilgamesh declares war on Pedro, and due to the Defensive Pact, Peter declares war on Gilgamesh. However, Cleopatra does not automatically declare war on either Pedro or Peter. Emergencies do not trigger Defensive Pacts, either.

But as you reach later eras, more slots in different combinations will be unlocked. On top of this, governments have their own special bonuses; the Theocracy government, for instance, will add Religious [ICON_Strength] Strength in Theological Combat, [ICON_Faith] Faith per Citizen in cities with [ICON_GOVERNOR] Governors, and allow you to purchase land units with [ICON_Faith] Faith and offers a discount on [ICON_Faith] Faith purchases when active.</Text>

			<Text>Early in the game, the only American advantage is +5 [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength on their home continent. They will want to expand fast across their continent and move to gain the support of the nearby city-states. With diplomatic policy slots turning into wildcard ones, their choice of government is important, though Classical Republic and Merchant Republic are the most helpful with America's preference: a Culture Victory. They should also consider building toward the National History Museum in their Government Plaza.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_11_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Declaring war on another civilization will give you a penalty in dealing with other civilizations in the game, called the warmonger penalty. This reflects other leaders’ mistrust or fear of your actions. The most common way to declare war, and the method by which all warmonger penalties are computed, is the Formal War. In this, a civilization first denounces a target civilization and then declares a Formal War.
			</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_11_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>The warmonger penalty increases with each era, as war becomes a less acceptable solution to the disagreements between the civilizations of the world. The warmonger penalty is also modified by the kind of war you declare. In most cases, declaring war and capturing an enemy city will give you that era’s warmonger penalty, and razing a city will give you three times that era’s warmonger penalty. Certain Casus Belli (see the section on Casus Belli under Diplomacy) may modify these warmonger penalties, reducing them for certain actions, or making them more expensive. Other actions, like using nuclear weapons, will modify your warmonger penalty as well.

			<Text>Pillaging a district takes 3 Movement Points, or all of your movement. Each building in a district must be pillaged separately, and awards some sort of plunder based on the district. Refer to the district's page for specific yields. Once pillaged, a building cannot be pillaged again until it is brought back online by its owner (done through the Production Menu and takes 25% of the [ICON_Production] Production cost of initial construction of that building.)</Text>

			<Text>Historic Moments are significant events that happen throughout the history of the game, ranging from being the first to choose a new form of government, to building a Unique Unit, to discovering Natural Wonders. There are dozens of these Historic Moments through the course of the game, representing world-first and player first achievements. These moments differ through the eras. For example, clearing a Barbarian Camp in the Ancient Era is an important milestone, but clearing one in the Modern Era won't even merit acknowledgement. You can view your Historic Moments at any time in your game by clicking on the History Timeline in the upper left toolbar. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each Historic Moment adds towards your Era Score for the era, which is the measure of whether you will rise into a Golden Age or sink into a Dark Age in the next era. If you are gaining lots of Historic Moments in an era, it means you are likely to go into a Golden Age in the next era. If you are the first player in the world to get a Historic Moment, you will earn more Era Score points. </Text>

			<Text>As the game progresses from era to era your civilization can enter a Golden Age or a Dark Age. If you're doing better than the other civilizations or completing many Historic Moments, then there is a good chance you will enter a Golden Age in the next era. If you start falling behind, you might fall into a Dark Age. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Golden Age is a time of great prosperity for your people. Your Loyalty decays at a lower rate than normal. Not only are your cities more likely to stay in your civilization, but you might even convert nearby cities into your civilization as well. In addition, you can choose a Dedication for the next era. Dedications are powerful bonuses that apply to a specific part of your civilization. But be aware that earning a Golden Age makes it harder to earn the next Golden Age, and easier to fall into a Dark Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dark Ages are difficult periods of time for your people. Your Loyalty decays faster than normal, which may lead to the cities at the edge of your civilization leaving and becoming independent cities, or being conquered by other players and integrated into their civilization. You can help prevent this by using your [ICON_GOVERNOR] Governors, or by strategically choosing to lose cities (and maybe hope to reconquer them later.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Don't worry or be too upset if you fall into a Dark Age because you have the chance to enter a Heroic Age. Your threshold for entering a Golden Age will be lower if you're in a Dark Age, and if you pass that Golden Age threshold, you will enter a Heroic Age. A Heroic Age lets you choose three Dedications in the next era! This may actually set you ahead of a player who goes from Golden Age to Golden Age, if you're able to take advantage of your abilities.</Text>

			<Text>If you exceed the Era Score threshold for a Dark Age, but do not have a high enough score to enter a Golden Age, then you enter into a Normal Age. During a Normal Age you may still choose a Dedication for that age, but you do not gain any other bonuses or penalties.</Text>

			<Text>Dark Ages also give you access to special Dark Age Policies. These wildcard policies can provide you with options to emerge from a Dark Age, but carry a cost.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_LOYALTY_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Loyalty is a city’s measure of its devotion to your civilization. Every city has a Loyalty value from 0 to 100, which reflects how much the [ICON_Citizen] Citizens of the city want to stay as part of your civilization. When the Loyalty drops below 75, the city’s yields and growth are penalized 25%. When the Loyalty drops below 25, the city’s yields are penalized 50% and growth is penalized 75%. When Loyalty reaches 0, the city revolts against its owner and becomes a Free City. Free Cities belong to no civilization and will seek to defend themselves from military intrusion. If a Free City’s Loyalty drops to 0, its experiment of independence fails, and they seek to join a civilization. Which civilization they request to join depends on who exerted the most pressure on the Free City during their independence. In this way, a Free City may be peacefully brought into your civilization (or brought back into your civilization).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_LOYALTY_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Loyalty changes each turn based on many factors, but the most important factor is the pressure of [ICON_Citizen] Citizens who live in or near the city. If pressure from your own [ICON_Citizen] Citizens outweighs pressure from other civilizations, the city’s Loyalty will increase (up to +20 per turn). If other civilizations’ pressure is stronger, the city’s Loyalty will decrease (down to -20 per turn). Each [ICON_Citizen] Citizen exerts a base pressure of 1, but it can be modified. For example, [ICON_Citizen] Citizens in a Capital city exert an additional 1 pressure. Golden and Heroic Ages add 0.5 for all [ICON_Citizen] Citizens, while Dark Ages subtract 0.5. This [ICON_Citizen] Citizen pressure affects cities within 9 tiles, but is 10% less effective per tile distant.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_LOYALTY_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>The city’s [ICON_GOVERNOR] Governor and Happiness level are other strong factors that affect a city’s Loyalty per turn. Additionally, cities conquered with military force will receive Loyalty penalties based on the conqueror's Grievances caused against the city's original owner, but these can be mitigated by keeping a garrisoned military unit in the city. Use the Loyalty lens to get a view of Loyalty factors, including the sources of pressure from other nearby cities.

The amount of 'transition' time is dependent upon the Governor. Once a particular Governor has established themselves in a city and then leaves, their established time there will start to decay over time. After the requisite amount of time, the Governor's special abilities come into effect. This includes their base ability, as well as any promotions they have been given.

If a Governor is assigned to a city that already contains a Governor, the existing Governor is taken out of the city and is put back into your Governor pool, ready to be assigned to a new location.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Governors can only be assigned to cities within their civilization with two exceptions.

To enter into an Alliance, you must first be Declared Friends with the civilization, and both civilizations must have researched the Civil Service civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several Alliance types, each one provides different mutual benefits according to its type. The effects of these levels are cumulative, so if you are in a Level 3 Alliance, you also gain the Level 1 and Level 2 effects. When you are in an Alliance with another Player, you gain Alliance Points every turn.  Collecting enough increases your Alliance Level, resulting in more benefits from your Alliances.  You can increase the rate at which you gain Alliance Points by trading with your Ally.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Every Alliance, regardless of its type, provides Open Borders and a Defensive Pact to both parties. Members of an Alliance cannot declare war on each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may have only one kind of alliance with another civilization, and once you have created that alliance, you cannot have it with another civilization, although you might have another kind of alliance with them.

			<Text>The English word "Warlord" is of relatively modern coinage (it first appears in the 1850s) but the concept of the military leader of a civilization with outsized power is an ancient one. Analogous terms such as "Dux Bellorum" in Latin (the origin of the noble title "duke"), or junfa in Chinese during the 20th Century, have appeared independently multiple times throughout history, inevitably linked to the idea of a military leader whose actual power exceeds that of his notional rulers.

It is frequently viewed as one of, if not the most, important offices of the head of state, as it serves as the agency that represents the nation or civilization on the world stage.

Authors, filmmakers and poets such as Lord Byron, Thomas Mann, William Shakespeare, Daphne du Maurier, and many, many others have found inspiration in the old city clinging to the side of the sea. The city’s heart is built on an island in the middle of a lagoon, and as such Venice is a city that lives intimately with water. Given its mercantile history, it is a city that has always done this. In fact, the Doge (a term derived from the Latin word for “duke,” not “doge” as in the Internet meme) of Venice would symbolically “marry” the sea on special occasions. The correct term for a state such as Venice is a thalassocracy – a maritime republic. A sea country.</Text>

With Italy in shambles, Venice allied with the remnants of Rome – the Byzantines – but eventually broke away and became an independent city-state.

In the east, Venice supported its old ally Byzantium as it held out against the Ottoman Turks, a thing that the Ottoman Sultan did not forgive or forget, and Venice saw its ships plundered and ports cut off as the Ottomans gained power across the eastern Mediterranean. Further, to the west, Portuguese sailors perfected long-distance seaborne trade to East Asia, thereby cutting off the need to deal with the Mediterranean (and Venetian ships) at all.</Text>

But there are some political philosophers who point out that the last nation standing in an arms race comes out the winner, and if you can bankrupt your opponent along the way, so much the better. This has led to things like the battleship arms race before the First World War, and the Strategic Defense Initiative of the Cold War, which in retrospect seem like they were not the wisest use of everyone’s tax dollars. </Text>

During the European Dark Age following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, for example, monasteries in many locations copied and preserved texts that were lost in secular libraries or private collections. These texts may not go into wider circulation during this time, but the efforts of these religious communities can prevent this knowledge from total loss.

The Inquisitions of Spain are most famous (infamous would probably be more accurate), but similar Inquisitions were set up throughout Europe and the New World during the Protestant Reformation.  The inquisition process was, by and large, unfavorable to the accused. This had suppressive effects on free inquiry more broadly as a result, in lands where the inquisitions were most active.</Text>

The Tokugawa Shogunate’s closing of Japan is one of history’s most famous examples of isolationism, lasting for about 250 years.

Those who carry these letters are privateers, as distinguished from pirates (because piracy without a nation backing you is illegal.) Letters of Marque were an extremely popular tool of military policy during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and could be a lucrative investment for backers of a successful privateer. The value of a captured prize was divided amongst the privateer’s backer and crew, and could be quite an enormous sum, which tended to attract seasoned sailors, drawn to the prospect of making a year’s pay in a bright and sunny afternoon. </Text>

The French knight of the high Middle Ages is another example, the result of superior equipment and long training.

It can be hierarchical (where individuals are praised in terms of their ability to fit within the hierarchy) or more lateral (where equality between individuals in the group is emphasized.) Various collectivist economic and social experiments have been conducted through the ages, with varying degrees of success. The forced collectivization of Soviet farms during the 1920s was an unmitigated disaster. The ubuntu theology movement of South Africa informed that country’s Truth and Reconciliation Committee and the dismantling of the Apartheid system.

A nation may choose to ignore those norms to gain some advantage, and when this is done repeatedly or flagrantly, the nation is branded a “rogue state.” This often results in political isolation for the regime, but it may allow the renegade nation to get away with what it wants, as the costs of punishing the rogue state may be higher than the community of nations is willing to pay. Rogue states may be complete political pariahs, or they may have a small handful of patron nations willing to prop them up (sometimes a failed rogue state is more dangerous than a stable rogue state.)

The appellation “robber baron” previously applied to nobles of the Holy Roman Empire who used their lands as a base for predatory practices, and went on to be applied to men like the Carnegies, Rockefellers, Stanfords, Cookes, and Dukes of the Gilded Age business world.
