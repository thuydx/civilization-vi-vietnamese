			<Text>There are a few ways to declare war. The first requires you move a military unit you control into another civilization's unit. This will prompt a pop-up message to appear asking if you want to start a war. Alternately, war can be declared in the Diplomacy Window. Within that window, you will always have the option to make a surprise declaration of war, except against your declared allies. Your civilization will suffer a costly [ICON_STAT_GRIEVANCE] Grievances penalty if you make a surprise declaration of war. To avoid some of this penalty (but not all), denounce the offending civilization and soon the option to formally declare war will appear in the Diplomacy Window.</Text>

			<Text>As a Francophone Liberal, Laurier faced two primary sources of political opposition. The first was the conservative governments of Macdonald (and later Mackenzie). The second was the Catholic clergy. At that point in history, the Catholic Church was decidedly ultramontanist—a movement defined by its hostility to liberal political orders and its insistence on the hierarchy of the clergy—and given the strength of Catholicism in the identity of Francophone Canadians, this was a strong political adversary.  Laurier argued that the liberalism he espoused was not hostile to Catholicism, but endorsed a political reform that would strengthen institutions and argued that a separation of church and state provided the clergy with a way to influence politics through argument and reasoning, not through fiat. This position, generally accepted as reasonable in the 21st Century, was, at the time, a new path forward for two hostile political camps, describing how they might find common ground in the political domain. Laurier articulated this vision best in an 1877 speech in Quebec, just as the Vatican's representative was travelling through Canada with instructions for the clergy on political issues.</Text>

The Janissary soldiers are an illustrative example of this mix of practices. Originally these were Christian-born boys who were consigned to the Ottoman state as tax or tribute, converted to Islam and raised in the strict, martial life of a soldier. Janissary life was governed by strict laws and discipline. They were forbidden to marry or own significant property, and were intensely loyal and considered the elite infantry of the empire.</Text>

Even for nations that did not actively fear Ottoman invasion, there was a healthy respect for the military and economic power of the empire. For most of the Renaissance and early Industrial period, there was a simmering conflict between the Islamic Ottomans and the Christian Europeans, with both sides choosing to emphasize the religious difference during times of conflict, while downplaying the difference during eras of peace.</Text>

This system used individual glyphs to represent different sound components of a word, and required the scribe to memorize fewer glyphs than any other logographic system (such as Egyptian hieroglyphics) meaning that literacy could be taught more easily. The wide circulation of Phoenician traders spread the system to the Phoenician's trading partners in a relatively short time. The earliest known traces of the written language are no younger than the mid-16th Century BCE, and may be centuries older than that. Greek (and its descendents), Hebrew, and Aramaic (and by extension Arabic) scripts are all derived from Phoenician.

			<Text>A nation with a sterling reputation in conducting international affairs may be said to have an ample store of diplomatic capital, which it can use to influence the foreign policies of other nations. Usually nations gain this through mediating international disputes, providing morally unambiguous benefit to those who cannot repay it, or through participating in an internationally-sanctioned military action against a malign foe. The actual size of a nation is sometimes irrelevant—in diplomacy the value of one’s word is not always dependent on the number of divisions one commands.</Text>

			<Text>Since the middle of the Twentieth Century, attitudes towards war between nations favor action by multiple nations agreeing to a common objective, rather than individual nations acting in their own interest. This system is assumed to represent a wider portion of the attitudes of people at large, and thus is more justified, should one believe that sovereignty rises directly from people. Successful global military coalitions have been formed by both the United Nations and by blocs of nations working in concert in a variety of armed conflicts. Junior partners in these coalitions may sometimes be induced to join a “coalition of the willing” through incentives through the senior partners in cases where the moral basis for the coalition is more ambiguous.</Text>

			<Text>The term “plausible deniability” is used to describe espionage actions which may be disavowed by the diplomats and public figures within the state that undertook them. Of these methods, non-state actors are the most common. In this system, the spies of a state provide support to individuals or groups seeking to undermine enemies of the state. The state may (technically) claim not to have undertaken the effort—they just paid someone else to do it. This may include cases where the intelligence agency does not possess the expertise in a new system of subversion but has access to a like-minded group that does. It becomes more difficult for the aggrieved party to bring a united front against the state in this case.</Text>

			<Text>Because a man on horseback sees himself as physically and morally superior to a man on foot, especially in a military, mounted troops have long enjoyed prestige that extends beyond the military to the society at large.

Certainly the knightly orders and samurai of the middle ages are the best documented examples of this, but the Equites of Rome and the Companions of Alexander, as well as the Keshik of the Mongols count as well (elite even within the cavalry-heavy Mongol army).Sometimes the mounted elite will commandeer state resources towards maintaining their equipment.

			<Text>Improvements to the reliability and manufacture of firearms during the Renaissance placed these weapons in the hands of increasingly large numbers of soldiers. Coupling this with the rise of the nation-state and its ability to conscript subjects to serve in the army, and generals found themselves with a new problem: The need to convey specific, technical knowledge to largely ignorant masses of conscripts. To this, the drill manual was developed.

			<Text>The initial reaction to every new cultural art form in each generation is for the previous generation to declare, with shock and horror, that a new art form is corrupting the public morals and leading directly down the steep and slippery slope to the end of all that is good. Because of this, the old generation declares, the new art form must be banned for the public good. If there are any universal human experiences beyond death, taxes, and war, then intergenerational fights over culture are a strong contender. Rock music in particular seems to have come in for its fair share of criticism during its explosive growth during the Twentieth Century. The tension between fun- and music-loving young people and their censorious elders has become something of a trope in the west, and any attempts to ban music generally seem doomed to failure, or perversely encourage interest in the forbidden fruit. Whether laws specifically banning the sale of music by western musicians inside the Communist bloc of nations, or conservative western elements banning (even oblique) references to canoodling, these measures are generally regarded as quixotic failures by The Man.</Text>

			<Text>The term “flower power” emerged from the late-60s milieu of Hippiedom, first as a pacifistic rejection of the Vietnam War, then as a general call for the re-ordering of society with an explicit rejection of militarism, especially in the context of demonstration. In these events, protestors could often be seen placing flowers in the barrels of the weapons of National Guard and police forces sent to keep order. As the commodification of counterculture continued through to the early 1970s, “flower power” became a catchall for dress styles, psychedelia, and an effort to brand products for people who weren’t about branding, man. </Text>

			<Text>The highly interconnected weapons systems of the information age rely on a mix of military and commercial components, processes, and software, creating what is essentially a new logistics reality for military professionals. Although interconnected weapons systems provide enhanced firepower and effectiveness (as anyone who’s witnessed highlight reels of smart bombs striking can attest), they do create a potential weakness. An opponent can attack the computer infrastructure of a modern military, often achieving better results than if they had tried to attack that same force directly.  "Cyber Warfare" can roughly be defined as a formal attempt to degrade, destroy, or weaken the communications and computer infrastructure of a modern military. Some military theoreticians also use this term to refer to operations against civilian targets, like power grids.</Text>

			<Text>Advances in computer-assisted work began in manufacturing, with robots engaging in work that humans normally performed. Naturally, this led to the replacement of humans by robots in many industries. There were absolutely no unintended consequences from this event, nor are there any impacts still reverberating through the political and economic world. Now, with the proliferation of machine learning and big data, many analytical jobs that were previously the domain of highly-paid specialists -- designers, actuaries, underwriters, bankers, clinical diagnosticians, and so forth -- can now be done by machines. There will be absolutely no downsides, unintended consequences, or negative outcomes from this transformative change in the workforce.

			<Text>One of the most insidious developments of the information age is the proliferation of disinformation which is not only factually incorrect, but embedded within a self-reinforcing set of values and assumptions that makes it difficult for those who buy into the system to mentally disengage from it. Intentional construction of parallel discourses is now part of the toolbox of social control for regimes that wish to restrict the amount of unorthodoxy within their populations. Ideas not sanctioned within a disinformation campaign are usually explained away as aberrations or perversions or, charitably, misunderstandings of the Right Way of Things. The state-run, propaganda-heavy media of North Korea is perhaps the best-known example of this today, but ample instances of this exist through history, and make for disquieting reading.</Text>
