			<Text>This low-lying area adjacent to a River has flooded before, giving it more [ICON_Food] Food production than a usual Desert tile. If the River floods again structures built on this tile may be damaged or destroyed, but the tile is also likely to gain additional yields.</Text>

			<Text>This low-lying area adjacent to a River has not yet flooded so it starts the game with the same yields as a flat Grasslands tile. If the River floods again structures built on this tile may be damaged or destroyed, but the tile is also likely to gain additional yields.</Text>

			<Text>This mountain tile, probably located near a boundary between two continents, starts the game as an inactive volcanic site but may become active as the game progresses. Once active, beware -- an eruption could occur at any time. Volcanic eruptions damage features and structures in adjacent tiles but may also leave behind volcanic soil that boosts the yields from that location.</Text>

			<Text>The ground in this area, probably located near a boundary between two continents, has been ruptured by subterranean geothermal activity. Heated water and steam escape from the ground here, making it ideal to place structures such as Aqueducts, Roman Baths, and Hungarian Thermal Baths nearby.</Text>

			<Text>This land adjacent to a volcano has suffered from a previous eruption. Although people and structures may have been damaged, the rich deposits of minerals the volcano has brought forth have probably enhanced the yields here. Rebuilding in this area may therefore be worthwhile, especially if the volcano goes dormant.</Text>
