			<Text>This game mode makes Dark Ages and Golden Ages more potent than ever. Heroic Ages are removed, and players can only be in a Normal Age in the first era. After that, they will either earn a Dark or a Golden Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of making Dedications, players get access to powerful new Social Policies based on their Age. Dark Policies make a return with refreshed powerful effects. Brand new Golden Policies are available to those who make it to a Golden Age. To keep earning Era Score, complete Techs and Civics and earn military unit promotions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dark Ages are particularly dangerous. Players in Dark Ages will have a portion of their empire immediately fall into Free Cities, and Free Cities can exert pressure on other cities. On easier difficulty settings, AI players lose a lot of cities. On harder difficulty settings, human players do. On Prince, they lose an equal amount.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Georgia's civilization unique ability is brand new, to match the mode's unique rules.</Text>
